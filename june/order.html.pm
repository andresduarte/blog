This document describes how I intend to get organized.

I've identified my problem to be the continual accumulation of divergent thoughts. I know that I will sooner die than stop learning. So there is no alternative for me but to become a man of letters. I must learn to process information effectively and efficiently or risk going loony. To achieve this goal I've come up with the following system.

◊section{System}
There should be a formal record of everything I perceive to know or understand. In other words, If it's not in my notes it effectively doesn't exist. Said notes are to be divided into three parts.

◊section{Part 1}
Because of convenience and the potential neurological advantage

◊section{Part 2}
◊margin-note{Chronological notes will seldom be edited.}
To counter the pitfalls of hand-written notes, All notes are to be translated into their digital equivalent, and placed into a chronologically arranged repository, every work night.

◊section{Part 3}
◊margin-note{Chronological notes should reflect life. Thematic notes should reflect understanding.}
Lastly, chronologically notes are to be translated to their thematically ordered equivalent.

◊section{Conclusion}

Chaos gives me anxiety, but it's also necessary to the creation of interesting work. Every time I've tried to force myself into doing something or behaving in some unnatural way I've failed miserably. Today I am abandoning all hopes of ever achieving this. My grandest aspiration will henceforth be to record life faithfully.
