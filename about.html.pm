◊os{Matthew Butterick} I got my degree in design and typography at Harvard University. I began my career as a font designer in Boston. At the beginning of the Internet era, I started Atomic Vision, a website-design company in San Francisco. Later, I attended UCLA law school and became a member of the California bar. In 2012, I received the Legal Writing Institute’s Golden Pen Award for ◊em{Typography for Lawyers}.

My other projects include Practical Typography, an online book (◊link{http://practicaltypography.com}), the fonts ◊xref{Equity}, ◊xref{Concourse}, ◊xref{Triplicate}, and ◊xref{Advocate}, and Pollen, software for publishing electronic books (◊link{http://pollenpub.com}).

I live in Los Angeles with my wife Jessica and Roxy the boxer.

You can reach me at ◊link["mailto:mb@typographyforlawyers.com"]{mb@typographyforlawyers.com}. I welcome comments and corrections. I do not, however, dispense individualized critiques or recommendations. Nor do I have Word templates to give away. After all, the point of the book is for you to learn how to do these things yourself.
