Some topics in this book will offer you choices. Not this one.

◊strong{Always put exactly one space between sentences.}

Or more generally: put exactly one space after any punctuation.

Here’s a paragraph with one space between sentences:

◊indented{I know that many people were taught to put two spaces between sentences. I was too. But these days, using two spaces is an obsolete habit. Some say the habit originated in the typewriter era. Others believe it began earlier. But guess what? It doesn’t matter. Because either way, it’s not part of today’s typographic practice. If you have to use a typewriter- style font, you can use two spaces after sentences. (These are also known as ◊xref{monospaced fonts}.) Otherwise, don’t.}

Now the same paragraph, but with two spaces between sentences:

◊indented{I know that many people were taught to put two spaces between sentences.  I was too.  But these days, using two spaces is an obsolete habit.  Some say the habit originated in the typewriter era.  Others believe it began earlier.  But guess what?  It doesn’t matter.  Because either way, it’s not part of today’s typographic practice.  If you have to use a typewriter-style font, you can use two spaces after sentences.  (These are also known as ◊xref{monospaced fonts}.)  Otherwise, don’t.}

I could tell you that in the second paragraph, the extra spaces disrupt the balance of white space. I could warn you that multiplied across a whole page, “rivers” of white space can appear. But mostly, one space is the well-settled custom of professional typographers. You don’t need to like it. You only need to accept it.

◊(omission)

I have no idea why so many writers resist the one-space rule. If you’re skeptical, pick up any book, newspaper, or magazine and tell me how many spaces there are between sentences.

Correct — one.
